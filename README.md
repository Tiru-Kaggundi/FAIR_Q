# FAIR_Q
Questions to ask the AI teams working on AI for governance - for policymakers, parliamentarians and judiciary


An AI team walks up to the policymakers and says, "Hey, here this. We have developed this AI that can do (so and so great things) 
for the public and you should launch it immediately."

The policymaker is apprehensive and asks, 
"But how do I know it would do no harm. Or screw my chances at the next promotion. 
Or get my minister beaten at the next election, because your AI does something that it shoudn't be doing."
The AI team retorts, 
"Boss, we have checked the accuracy score. It is 99.9%. The F1, recall and yada yada measures are great. 
It won't go wrong. Don't worry."

Policymaker: "what about fairness, ethics, privacy and other such concerns."

AI team: "Ha, leave it to us. 
The algorithm is fair, the data is private and there is no ethical concerns that we could find during our internal audit."

Policymaker wonders if there is something concrete that can be asked to the AI team. 
What did the team actually even mean when they talked about all those scores? 
What did they mean by saying that algorithm is fair. 

FAIR-Q attempts to develop questionnaire for AI teams that may be used by policymakers, legislators (parliamentarians) and judiciary.
